## 📚 API Reference

We use the free public API from JSONPlaceholder:

```url
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
Each user contains:

name

email

address (street, city)

phone

website

company (name)

📄 License
This project is free to use for learning and personal purposes.


If you want, I can also add **Markdown badges** for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API usage so it looks more stylish on GitHub. That would make it pop.
